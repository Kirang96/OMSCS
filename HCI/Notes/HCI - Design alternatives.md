This is the second phase of design life cycle where we figure out how we accomplish the tasks that users require.
An important mistake is to continue with a single design and not think about anything else. This also includes not thinking differently from existing designs.
Design space is the area that we design the interface. So we try to stay away from the current design space while designing a new one. In that way we will have large space for new designs such that we're not constrained to a specific current design.

Next step is to brainstorm different ideas. Brainstorming should be first done at an individual level. Think about how designing can be done for several cases like, different types of audiences, different inputs, different inputs like smartphones, AR etc.

Tips for brainstorming:
1. Write down the core problem: We have to form ideas based on that
2. Constrain yourself: Force yourself to think of ideas in specific areas. Like which are too expensive or not physically possible.
3. Aim for 20: create 20 ideas in short sentences
4. Take a break: Maybe 20 mins to a couple of days
5. Divide and conquer: Divide the problem to several tasks and brainstorm for each of them.

#### Group brainstorming

There are several challenges to group brainstorming. 

1. Social loafing: Tendency to exert less effort in groups than working alone.
2. Conformity: Tendency to agree with or follow the group's reasoning and ideas.
3. Production blocking: Tendency of some individuals in discussions to block other individual's participation.
4. Performance matching: Tendency to match one's level of performance to other collaborator's.
5. Power dynamics: Tendency to defer to more senior individual, or to overpower less senior individuals.

To prevent these, we should put some rules:
1. Expressiveness: Every idea should be shared
2. Non-evaluation: no evaluation or criticizing
3. Quantity: Create many ideas
4. Building: Build on other's ideas.
5. stay focused: Keep the goal in mind
6. No explaining ideas: say the idea and move on
7. Revisit the problem often: To not wander off topic
8. Encourage others: To make everyone speak

Tips for group brainstorming:
1. Go through every individual idea
2. Find the optimal size: Should not be more than 5 people
3. Set clear rules for communication: Set a time limit for each person
4. Set clear expectations
5. End with ideas, not decisions

This will leave us with a few high level design ideas

Now we pick out 3 or 4 ideas to flesh out and to the prototyping stage.
We can keep some ideas, dismiss others or maybe combine a few. 

#### Personal

Create several personal which we think might be using the interface. We can create names, a background about them, employment, family, interests and other details. We can create 3-4 personas like this and think in their terms on how they would be using the different design alternatives.

#### User profiles

When we design, it is better to find the types of people we'll designing it for. Designing with everyone in mind is not a good idea. Select the types from each category and cater to them specifically. Each decision will have something to keep in mind while designing.

#### Timeline:

![[Pasted image 20240905141810.png]]

For a persona, the things they would do would be different at different times. If we think about the timeline they would be doing some specific tasks the interface is designed to do, we can get more insights. 
As an example, if a persona called Anika is exercising while listening to an audiobook, we can create a timeline like this. From here we can expect her to have different moods. If she is very excited to exercise she might forget to set up an audiobook and we could put a reminder to do it when she is at the park.

#### Scenarios:

This is similar to timeline, but instead of considering the routine timeline, we will consider specific scenarios that the user might face while using the app.
For example, while a user is listening to an audiobook and if a fire engine passes through the road, user loses about 30 seconds of content and at that point they would need to rewind the audiobook. We can think how we would solve this problem in this scenario. Can we use a touch based controls, or voice based or maybe gesture based controls to rewind the audiobook?

15 principles created from different design principles books:

1. Discoverability
Users should be able to find the functions if they need it. Functions can be displayed to the user so they can discover them, without relying them learning it from elsewhere. It does not mean we can display everything at the same time to the user. It is a line between simplicity and usability. 
2. Simplicity
Making the designs easy for users to understand it without much cognitive load
3. Affordances
Objects can be designed in the way that it will be obvious how it will be used. eg. Buttons are meant to be pushed and handles are meant to be pulled.
It can also be artificially created in interfaces. Buttons in the interface appear protruding out when we hover over it and it will appear pushed out when we press it. Not everything has a real-world meaning, so we have to create it in that context. For example, the menu button in websites or arrows to indicate which direction to swipe. They are called signifiers and they are in-context instructions. This is how we create our own affordances.

Affordance vocabulary: 
Affordance: Affordance is the actual inherent properties of the device.
Perceived affordance: This is the property attributed to the object by a human observer.
Signifier: It is anything that helps match the perceived affordance to actual affordance

For example: For push bar door is designed for the bar to go inside the handle to unlock the door. This is how it inherently works and that's the affordance. The perceived affordance is the pushability of the door. A sticker can be placed on the door to inform the user that the door is meant to be pushed and that will be a signifier.

4. Mapping
Mapping refers to creating interfaces where the design makes it clear what the effect will be when using them.
For example, light switches with corresponding stickers which shows which switch turns on which light.

5. Perceptibility
This is the users ability to see the state of the system.
eg. Looking at the light switch we can see if the switch is on or off. But looking at the fan pull cable we won't be able to say if it is on or off.

6. Consistency
This is to be consistent with what other people have done on the same platform. Small change to something existing can follow the old ways of doing things because people are used to it but a bigger change can go with new ways as that is how changes are made.
eg. copy paste shortcut keys, 

7. Flexibility
Allowing people to stick with whatever they're comfortable with. 

8. Equity
This is similar to flexibility. It says that we must be equal to both novice and expert users. eg. Password creation is similar to all users. Everyone must complete the same criteria to create a new password.

9. Ease and 10. comfort
Ease is when user is able to use the design with efficiency and minimum fatigue. Comfort is when design has enough space and size for proper usage regardless of user's body size, posture and mobility.

11. Structure
It says we should organize user interface in ways that helps user's mental model to match the actual content of the task.
eg. newspaper website still follow newspaper grid structure since it is easy to navigate and compact.

12. Constraints
This is the idea to prevent the users from making mistakes by not offering them the chance to do it. We can put soft and hard constraints. Soft constraints is when we allow them to do it but warns against it and hard constraints is when we forcefully not allow them to do it. 
eg. When user is creating a new password, we warn them if they cannot use it and not allow them to paste some non-keyboard letters at all. 
Norman provides four types of constraints: physical, cultural, semantic and logical.

13. Tolerance
This means that the user shouldn't be at risk of causing too much trouble accidentally. There should be an undo and redo button to reverse their actions. 
Dix. et al calls this as the principle of recoverability. 

14. Feedback
There should be constant feedback to the user and it should inform what the error was, and how to avoid it in the future.
An example of bad feedback is windows BSOD. It is uninformative, scary, bold and cryptic.

15. Documentation
A good interface is the one that can be used without a documentation. Users should be able to discover the functions of the interface. But sometimes it might be necessary to provide one. It should be easy to search, focused on task and should list out concrete steps to be carried out.

Politics mean whether artifacts can personify specific forms of authority or power, whether for good or bad. This means we create interfaces to create change in the world. Other times, we also create interfaces that might be used and affect the world in ways we never anticipated. 

There are three main tasks of an interface.
Help: This is a usability goal where we can make it easier for a user to do a task
Understand: Create the interface for research so as to improve interfaces
Change: Change the user behavior. Eg: seat belt beeps to change the behavior of users to make them wear it.

The artifacts that we design will also have a political factor. According to Winner, there can be two cases:
1. The artifact maybe inherently political. eg: Nuclear missiles
2. Artifacts maybe used to serve a political purpose. eg: union making low quality products to serve a purpose
There can be designs that are made to make a negative change. In US, senator made parks and roads that connect to the park, but built a bridge to avoid poor people taking buses to the park. Only rich people with cars can go. 

There are positive impacts as well. Facebook adding more genders and marital statuses were positive impacts.

#### Changes as happenstance
Some changes that happen in the world are due to happenstance, meaning it has happened as a side effect of another intended change. eg: In older times, women were dependent on men to travel somewhere and were unable to do anything alone, but after the invention of bicycles, women were able to go anywhere they want. So, the invention of bicycles, made change in the places that women went to as well as the clothing industry (women changed the way they dressed to be better suited for cycling) among many others.
There can also be negative happenstance as well. When internet became popular, the areas with less advanced infrastructure got slower speed, while cities had faster connections. This wasn't intentional but natural.

#### Value sensitive design
Values of the people who use it also has to be taken into account while designing an interface. Privacy is one such value that must be considered. This is very complicated as different geographical locations have different values and cultures and making changes to interfaces for that is difficult. Eg: EU has a law called 'Right to be forgotten' which allows users to make the website remove all data about them from the internet. But it was difficult for Google to implement it in their website.

Tips:
1. Start early: identify values early and check on them through design process
2. Know your users: Users have different values and they might get conflicted. 
3. Consider both direct and indirect stakeholders: direct stakeholders are the direct users of the interface, but indirect stakeholders can also be affected by the interface, think about them as well.
4. Brainstorm the interface's possibilities: Think not only about how the interface is to be used, but how it could be used.
5. Choose carefully between supporting values and prescribing values: careful about when you choose to support the existing values and when you choose to try to change them with your interfaces.

#### Designing interfaces with political clouts in mind

1. We need to think about interfaces where we can invoke positive social change
2. We also need to think about possible negative ramifications of our interfaces.

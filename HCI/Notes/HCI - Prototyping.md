In this step we put forth some designs to the users.

Basics:
Early prototyping: Rapid revision on preliminary ideas
Late prototyping: Finishing touches on final designs

Fidelity: It refers to the completeness or maturity of the prototypes
Low-fidelity: paper drawings; easy to change
high-fidelity: Wireframe and working prototypes

Evaluation:
Low fid like a drawing can evaluate a function of an interface.
Wireframe can evaluate readability of interfaces
High fid is required for performance analysis

Scope:
Horizontal prototypes: Covers design as a whole but in shallow
Vertical prototypes: Covers small portion of the design in great detail
Usually in a design process we'll move between both scopes. First we'll do a horizontal prototype then choose each part and do vertical prototyping.

Tips:

1. Keep prototypes easy to change: Aim is to rapid revisions
2. Make it clear that its a prototype: Adding too much details will make users focus on superficial details like colors and fonts.\
3. Be creative
4. Evaluate risks: Get feedbacks early to reduce time spent on bad designs
5. Prototype for feedback: Prototype for the kind of feedback and on the parts you need. Prototyping for fonts might not be a good idea.

##### Verbal prototype:

Telling others your idea. Difficult to convey complex ideas. subject to different biases like social desirability bias and expert blindspot bias.
Use analogies and metaphors to convey ideas.

##### Paper prototype

Drawing designs on papers
It is a quick way to share ideas and get feedback. 
We can easily make changes on the paper according the feedback very quickly

A version of this is called card prototyping.
In card prototyping we create different designs of the different screens of app on different papers and simulate users through the app.

##### Wizard of Oz:
This is for other interfaces like voice or gesture interface.
Here we do things that the interface would do manually once it is created. Humans would be supplying the functionality by manually changing the interface to simulate a audio or gesture interface.

##### Wireframing
We create more detailed tools to mock up what an interface might look like.
There are tools like: Balsamiq, axure, visio, indesign, pencil project and frame box.

##### physical protoypes

We use this when we want to create something physical or 3D. The physical prototype doesn't have to be working. We can take anything that is in the shape of what we need and pretend it is the object we designed and do prototype testing. It gives us a general idea of how it works. We can ask participants how it feels in hand while running, or how intuitive the buttons on the dummy object is etc.

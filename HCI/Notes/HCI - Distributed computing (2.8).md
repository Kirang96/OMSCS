Cognition is something that happens in our mind, but distributed cognition suggests models of cognition should be extended outside the mind. Instead of doing a complex problem in our mind, we can distribute the work load to several people or artifacts thereby reducing the load on each. Doing a complex mathematics task using pen, paper and our mind is easier than doing it just using our mind.

Distributed computing is related to computing load. When we're unloading a load to an artefact, we're trying to reduce our cognitive load.

Social interaction is also an important aspect to factor in as most of the latest technologies make use of it. Like Steam connects different people using game achievements.

Situated actions is another aspect. We have to consider different situations in which the app is going to be used.
1. We must examine the interfaces we design within the context in which they're used.
2. We must understand the task the user performs grows out of interaction with the interface.
3. The task doesn't exist until the user gets started, and once they start, they define the task.
Situated actions are closely related to memory. People who have contexts about something will have better memory than someone who doesn't.
For example, If I'm assigned a list of tasks to do, I might forget a few. But the person who assigned might not forget as they have context on why it was added to the list. 

Activity theory is like distributed computing, but here, we're generalizing the unit of analysis on the person and the activity he is doing. Activity theory focuses on why the user is doing a task.
Activity theory also lets us zoom out from the operator perspective to the action or activity as a whole.

These 3 theories are different and a paper from Nardi at 2.8:17 can be read to understand the finer points between these 3 theories.

This is the first stage of design life cycle. This is where we go and try to find out what the user really needs.

We need to answer some questions first before starting to gather the data about the design.
1. Who are the users?
2. Where are the users?
3. What is the context of the task?
4. What are their goals?
5. What do they need?
6. What are their tasks?
7. What are their subtasks?

Now we should understand the problem space. We should take into the consideration the broad approach by understanding the entire problem space and just narrowly focusing on the users interaction with the interface.
Then we understand user types. This will help us design the product specifically for that types of users and maybe even market it separately. An example of this is Sony Walkman.

Tips for needfinding:
1. Confirmation bias: When we have some preconceived ideas in our mind and we only notice the things that confirm our prior beliefs. 
2. Observer bias: This is when we might have bias to the study participants. It can happen when we're more helpful to the interfaces that we designed or we might phrase surveys that elicits the answer we want to hear. 
3. Social desirability bias: People might give good feedback to make you happy.
4. Voluntary response bias: People with strong opinions are likely to respond to optional surveys. This can be seen in online reviews where only very good and very bad reviews are present and people who're just satisfied with the products doesn't leave a review.
5. Recall bias: People forget how the activity was.

Tips for naturalistic observation
1. Take notes during the study
2. Start specific and then abstract/summarize. Summarizing too soon will cause tunnel vision.
3. Spread out your sessions: Try to spread out observation in short 10-15 mins sessions several times.
4. Find a partner
5. Look for questions

It is a good idea to be a participant and observe what you lack within the system. You'll get a better idea of what the user will need this way. eg: to test a audio book app, go for a run with it and find the problems you face.

Hacks and workarounds: Observe what hacks people use to use the interface in non-intended ways. These can tell you the problems with the interface. Why do people use post-it-notes even after having 6 monitors in their setup?

Errors: We can observe where people make mistakes and get an understanding about the user's mental model. We can ask people why they make the mistakes they made and get more understanding. This is not always possible in all scenarios such as an app for exercise. So, we'll have to ask people to participate in studies and get the information as surveys.

Apprenticeships and ethnography: If we're experts in a field, we can get much more insights into how it should be designed. If you're not an expert in one field, we can get apprenticeship under experts to understand how things work and then design interfaces.

Interviews and focus groups: Conduct interviews to understand user requirements. Create a group of people who use an application which is called a focus group and ask them questions. It should be done along with interviews as people in focus groups tends to confirm others opinion and form a biased output.

Tips for interviewing:
1. Focus on the six W's: who, what, where, when, why and how
2. Be aware of bias: phrase questions not to predispose the participant to views
3. Listen: Gather data instead of conversing. 
4. Organize the interview: Introduction, light question phase to build trust before moving to real questions and then to summary phase
5. Practice!

Surveys: This is a way to get large amount of data in short time. Unlike interviews, the data is not thorough but it can be gathered in large number through website surveys. These can be used to make decisions or to find what kind of questions to ask in interviews.

Tips for surveys:
1. Less is more: Get data with minimum number of questions
2. Be aware of bias: To not to force them to answer in any way
3. Tie them to the inventory: All questions should be required for the study
4. Test it out
5. Iterate: Test and change what doesn't work

Other data gathering methods like product reviews can also be used.

Needfinding is also not a single flow process that ends at evaluation stage. It is an iterative process that will do the needfinding again with the outputs from the evaluation to better understand the users. Within the different methods in needfinding information can be used to between each other to do better each time. For example naturalistic observation data can be used to create a better interview and participant observation can be used to create survey.

Once the needfinding is done we can create flowcharts and decision flows the user might make or any other diagrams with respect to the data we collected to better represent the needs.

With this we create a design requirements that must be included in the design. It should be specific and evaluable. It can include requirements from the user's tasks as well as from outside that we gathered from external project requirements like compatibility, compliance, cost etc.

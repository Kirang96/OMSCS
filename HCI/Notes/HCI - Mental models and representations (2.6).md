Mental model is an internal simulatable understanding of the world you hold around you. This can help one achieve the goal they have in mind. A good interface will provide a good mental model of the system it represents. In order to develop good mental models, we need to give users good representation of the system. If we have a good mental mode, we can simulate it in our head and predict what will happen next.
While designing an interface:
1. it should act just like how a user will predict with the mental model. 
2. Interface should teach its users how the interface will behave

Tips for creating learnable interfaces

1. Predictability
2. Synthesizability: For non-GUI: display actions that lead to the current state
3. Familiarity: Like affordances in [[HCI - design principles (2.5)]]
4. Generalizability: Knowledge of one interface must generalize to others
5. Consistency: Similar tasks within a same interface should behave similar.

#### Representations:

Using representations, we can choose how mental models are developed in user's head.
Characteristics: 

1. Good representations make relationships explicit
2. They bring objects and relationships together.
3. They get rid of extraneous details, by not showing non-relevant information. 
4. They expose natural constraints.

#### Analogies:

Analogies and metaphors are something in real life that we can use in interfaces so that it makes users easy to understand it.
A keyboard on mobile phone is made as an analogy to the original full size keyboard and so it is very easy for new users to understand. But the typing efficiency is not the same as a full size keyboard though. But we can design very efficient keyboard specific for mobile devices and that might not be very easy to learn.

"Analogies make the interface more learnable, but ,may restrict the interface to outdated constraints."

While using real-world analogies and interfaces that users already familiar with to make it easier for them to learn, at some point we'll have to design unique interfaces that users haven't seen before.

While designing interfaces, we need to have a steep learning curve or rapid learning curve where users gain expertise with little experience.

### User errors: Slips and mistakes

There are two types of mistakes that happen:
1. Slips: The user has the right mental model, but does the wrong thing anyway. These are of two types:
		1. Action-based: User performs a wrong action even though they knew the correct action
		2. Memory lapse: User forgets something that they knew.
2. Mistakes: The user has the wrong mental model, and does the wrong thing as a result.
		1. Rule-based mistakes: User understands, wrong decision
		2. Knowledge-based mistakes: User didn't understand, wrong decision
		3. Memory lapse: User forgets to fully execute the plan. User forgets to save file after working on it.
##### Learned helplessness

A user's sense that they are helpless to accomplish their goals in an interface.
If the user is not receiving an feedback from the interface there is nothing more a user could do to complete the task and they believe that there's nothing they can do to accomplish their goals.

##### Expert blind spot

When someone is an expert at doing something, some of the steps would be automatic or natural for us. So, if you're teaching that to someone we'll miss out a lot of steps that we just assume are obvious. That is the expert blind spot. When we're designing an interface we have to overcome that expert blind spot because we're not our users.

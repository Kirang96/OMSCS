This will look into how to actually design pages using all the principles we have learnt.

Tips for designing on-screen IU:
1. Use a grid
2. Use white space: it works with grid and provides context and guide the user's visual perception of the interface
3. Know your Gestalt principles: Those principles tell us about how users perceive groups of objects. Objects that looks similar or are placed together.
4. Reduce clutter
5. Design in grayscale: The content of the interface should be understood even without color. There are a lot of colorblind people in this world.

The prototyping and evaluation cycle we have studied is a very slow process and takes time through different iterations. But sometimes we need to do it fast. So we use agile methods for it.
The costs of developing a software has come down a lot from older times due to improvements in hardware and libraries. Distributing a software is even free due to the internet, while in the older days software were sold in stores. Getting a feedback is also easy and free as we can get usage feedback, logs and error reports, while in the olden days, we have to ask people to be present in person to provide a feedback. 
But still the programs should be developed and delivered fast.
So, the agile development is used mainly in places where updates and patches can be easily rolled out and when a few bugs cannot lead to major repercussions.

Live prototyping is a type of new technology where we design interfaces and go live in real time. Its a drag and drop application that lets us create live websites. This skips the prototyping phase but it can still be used in some cases where quick live apps provide more value than slow stable apps (eg e-commerce websites). 

This method still needs  a needfinding stage to understand user requirements, but the remaining steps like alternate designs, prototyping and evaluations stage is fast forwarded here.
#### AB testing

This is a testing method for live prototyping. Since in the live prototyping there is no separate prototyping phase, it can get difficult to get feedback. So, in AB testing, we create two interfaces with changes, and roll out the A or first interface to a small subset of users. If we see a positive impact, we roll it out to everyone, but if there is a dip in the impact, we switch with our alternate interface or B to see if it works. 

Tips for using HCI and agile development:
1. Start more traditional: An initial needfinding and prototyping can be done before agile development starts.
2. Focus on small changes in the interface
3. Adopt a parallel track method: Before the development team start the 2 week sprint, let the HCI team do a 2 week sprint before that (run a sprint in front) to do a needfinding, prototyping and low fidelity evaluation and handover the results to the development team for their development for their next sprint.
4. Be careful with consistency: We don't want to mess with constant user's expectations.
6. Nest your design cycles: Collect all the information you gather from small design cycles and use it to optimize a broader traditional design cycle for long term improvements.
